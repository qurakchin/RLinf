## The Prime Directive

All user-facing changes must be accompanied by at least documentation. Recommend adding CI tests as well if a new model, workflow, environment, or significant feature is introduced.

Raise severity of PR reviews to ensure this is followed. No PR involving user-facing changes should be approved without documentation updates.
