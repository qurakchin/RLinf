"""Per-environment eval pre/post-processing interface for ``openpi_pytorch``.

An :class:`EvalProcessor` turns raw env observations into a model
``Observation`` and maps sampled model actions back into env actions. Each
environment provides a concrete subclass (e.g. ``BehaviorEvalProcessor``); the
model factory selects one by env name via
:func:`rlinf.data.datasets.openpi_pytorch.get_eval_processer`, so the factory is
not coupled to any single environment.

This module is intentionally dependency-free (no torch / model imports) so it can
be imported cheaply when resolving the registry. It is a thin interface rather
than an ``abc.ABC`` so subclasses introduce no metaclass change.
